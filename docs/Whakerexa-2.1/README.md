# Whakerexa — A minimalist and lightweight web kit for accessible contents


## Overview

`Whakerexa` is a lightweight front-end toolkit that blends clarity, accessibility, and flexibility, and long-term maintainability.
It provides a modern CSS foundation and a fully modular ES6 JavaScript components to build interfaces that are both elegant and inclusive — with minimal code and maximum readability, without dependencies.

Designed around accessibility from the start, Whakerexa makes it easy to craft clean, human-friendly HTML that just works — without drowning your pages in class names or dependencies.
Every visual aspect — colors, typography, spacing, animations — is defined through CSS variables, giving you full creative control with a few redefinitions.

Version 2.0 introduces a unified public API through `wexa.js` and a stable global namespace through `wexa.bundle.js`, ensuring support for both modern ES6 module-based applications and offline/static environments.

It pairs naturally with `WhakerPy`, the lightweight Python library for generating dynamic HTML, offering a seamless workflow from code to design.

## Install Whakerexa

Whakerexa is distributed as a ZIP archive.  
Simply unpack it.


## Quick Start

For usage examples of the CSS and JS frameworks, visit the **online documentation**:

👉 <https://whakerexa.sourceforge.io>

The HTML files available in the `docs` folder are also provided for offline reference,
but note that dynamic examples (those using JavaScript modules) require a web server
and will not work if opened directly from your disk (`file://` protocol).

Browse the local documentation with:

> python -m http.server 8000 
```
Then open a new tab into Firefox with the url: http://localhost:8000/docs/

## Version 0.8

- This is mainly some debug.

## Version 1.0

Version 1.0 establishes Whakerexa as a modular, object-oriented web kit centered on a unified entry point.

- Core entry point: `wexa.js`, which instantiates:
    1. OnLoadManager — Delayed, ordered component initialization.
    2. WexaLogger — Unified logging.
    3. AccessibilityManager — Themes and contrast.
    4. MenuManager — Navigation menus and submenus.
    5. DialogManager — Opening/closing dialogs and popup videos.

- Menus are fully re-implemented (CSS + JS). See `docs/menu.html`.
- Dialogs are managed by `DialogManager` (legacy functions replaced).
- Backward compatibility with pre-1.0 procedural APIs is limited and not fully ensured.
- Not all minor/specialized classes have been ported (e.g., `Book`, `ToggleSelector`, `SortaTable`).

This version also includes a set of monochrome SVG icons.


## Version 2.0 — stable

Version 2.0 is a complete modernization.
Previous procedural APIs are not preserved.

- Unified ES6 entry point (`wexa.js`) exporting all components.
- `wexa.bundle.js` exposes the global namespace `window.Wexa` for `file://` usage.
- The `progress()` function is removed. Use the `ProgressBar` class instead (see `docs/progressbar.html`).
- Use `Wexa.onload` instead of `OnLoadManager`, `Wexa.dialog` instead of `DialogManager`, etc.
- `WexaLogger` is extended: numeric levels from 0 (most verbose) to 50 (critical only). Messages are shown when their level is >= the current `logLevel`.
- Improved `request.js`: JSON detection through `Content-Type` with silent fallback for non-JSON responses.
- Updated documentation and offline demos. Fixed license documentation to GFDL 1.3, except for slides. See: <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl-1.3.en.html> for details.
- Added an "extra" JS package for slides. Currently proposed as a PoC.
